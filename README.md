# Server-side Calculator


## Description

Creates a calculator app that demonstrates your understanding of the client/server request/response cycle. To ensure that your app is making sensible use of the request/response cycle:
* All mathematical logic **must** be implemented on the server.
* Calculation history data **must** be stored on the server.
* The client-side code **must** be able to:
  * Ask the server for its calculation history, then render it appropriately on the DOM.
  * Obtain "new calculation" data via user input, then send it to the server.
